# My Portfolio - (Under development)

This is just a [preview](https://matiasurielgluck.netlify.app/) of the new version of my portfolio. The main new feature of this version is the ability to manage its content, add new projects, modify existing ones and delete them. To do that, you need to be logged in as an administrator, with private credentials stored in a database.
